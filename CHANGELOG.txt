2014-03-17 --- 6.1:
   - Update of Picard from 1.93 to 1.107
   - Moving from ant to maven build
   - Hadoop version 2 compatability
   - Bugfixes for BAM reading

2013-07-08 --- 6.0:
   - Input and output formats for VCF and BCF. There are no format-specific
     InputFormat or OutputFormat classes; instead, AnySAM-like support for both
     in one class is provided.

     Both compressed and uncompressed BCF can be read, but only compressed BCF
     can be output.

     This required adding three .jar files to the Hadoop-BAM distribution, two
     from Picard and one from Apache Commons: variant-<version>.jar,
     tribble-<version>.jar, and commons-jexl-<version>.jar. All of these need
     to be provided in the Hadoop classpath or in '-libjars' when using CLI
     plugins that require the VCF/BCF functionality.

   - Added new 'fixmate' plugin, akin to the samtools fixmate command or
     Picard's FixMateInformation, i.e. recomputing mate information in the
     input SAM/BAM files. Like 'sort', it can also merge multiple SAM/BAM files
     together.

   - Added new 'vcf-sort' plugin, which sorts a single VCF or BCF input file
     while possibly performing format conversion, as it can also output either
     VCF or BCF.

   - Updated provided Picard from 1.76 to 1.93. Note that a breaking change
     concerning the SeekableStream class occurred in Picard 1.84, so a version
     older than that may not be used together with this version of Hadoop-BAM.

   - The FASTQ and QSEQ input formats can now skip records that have failed
     filtering: use the CONF_FILTER_FAILED_QC and CONF_INPUT_FILTER_FAILED_QC
     properties.

   - The FASTQ input format now accepts Illumina identifiers with a blank index
     sequence.

   - Fixed BAM records sometimes confusing the reference and mate reference
     indices, and not always updating the reference names appropriately.

   - Fixed various small misdecodings and misencodings in QSEQ I/O.

   - Fixed 'premature EOF' crashes on some BAM inputs.

   - Fixed crash on headerless SAM inputs.

   - Fixed CLI crash on startup in newer Hadoop versions (at least CDH 4.2.0).

   - Other minor fixes.

2012-11-26 --- 5.1:
   - Removed the fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which were deprecated
     back in 3.0.

   - MAJOR CHANGE: The command line plugins 'sort', 'summarize', and
     'summarysort' now default to 1 reduce task. The amount can be customized
     with the -r/--reducers command line argument. This bumps up the versions
     of the plugins to 4.0, 3.0, and 2.0 respectively.

   - Fix: BAMRecordReader.getKey now hashes unmapped keys instead of
     randomizing them, to ensure consistent results.

   - For compatibility with Hadoop 2.0 and any future Hadoop releases, custom
     Hadoop classes are now only built and used when using a Hadoop release
     that does not provide them. This means that bugs MAPREDUCE-1987 and
     MAPREDUCE-2538, which were previously fixed internally, may cause problems
     when using the MapReduce-using command line plugins with certain reducer
     counts.

   - Fixed crash on some BAM inputs caused by a bug in
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.BAMSplitGuesser.

   - Fixed some Illumina identifier scanning issues in the FASTQ input format.

   - Added FASTA input format.

   - The command line plugins 'sort' and 'summarize' now use RandomSamplers for
     input partitioning, as they probably should have all along.

2012-08-31 --- 5.0:
   - MAJOR CHANGE: Hadoop-BAM no longer depends on, or even provides,
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.samtools. In other words, users should now
     import Picard classes from Picard itself, i.e. net.sf.samtools.

   - Fix data loss/duplication and crash-on-valid issues in SAM input.

   - Fix FASTQ record writer to also write the flow cell ID and to emit null
     fields correctly.

   - Fix crash on some inputs caused by a bug in
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.hadoop.InputSampler. (Not the same bug as was
     fixed in 4.0.)

   - Updated provided Picard from 1.56 to 1.76.

   - BAMRecordReader.getKey now randomizes the order of unmapped reads instead
     of giving them all the same key, improving performance since they can now
     be sent to different reduce tasks.

   - AnySAMInputFormat now has a nullary constructor, allowing it to be used
     directly in Job.setInputFormatClass.

   - FASTQ and QSEQ input formats now report isSplitable correctly for
     compressed files.

   - QSEQ output format and record writer now use a Text instead of a
     NullWritable key.

2012-05-03 --- 4.0:
   - SAM input and output support. AnySAMInputFormat handles transparent
     support of both SAM and BAM inputs even in the same Hadoop job. For
     output, there is no SAMOutputFormat; only AnySAMOutputFormat, which can be
     used to output either SAM or BAM. BAMOutputFormat will be deprecated in
     the future.

   - Fix longstanding regression in the embedded Picard library causing
     end-of-file markers to be written into BAM files by every reduce task. For
     this reason e.g. 'samtools view' refused to show the contents of BAM files
     output by Hadoop-BAM.

   - Fix crash on some inputs caused by a bug in
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom.hadoop.InputSampler.

   - Fix possible crash-on-valid situations in heuristic BAM splitting.

   - Various I/O classes from the Seal project are now incorporated. This
     includes input formats for FASTQ and QSEQ and an output format for QSEQ.
     Thanks to Luca Pireddu!

   - Unmapped reads are now ordered after, not before, all other reads.

   - Allow using Hadoop's "-libjars" command line argument instead of
     HADOOP_CLASSPATH to specify the Picard .jars. This ended up being
     fiendishly complicated and somewhat fragile.

   - Partitioning files are now saved in the output, not input, directory.

   - 'sort' plugin version 3.0:

     * Important bug fix for merging: conflicting IDs from different files
       weren't being properly corrected.
     * SAM input and output support. Can input SAM and BAM files at the same
       time and output to either format.
     * When not using -o, each reducer now outputs headers into the BAM files.

   - 'view' plugin version 1.1, with SAM input support.

   - Add new 'cat' plugin version 1.0, for concatenating SAM/BAM files. The
     main intended use case is joining the output of 'sort' when it is used
     without -o.

   - 'summarize' plugin version 2.0, with SAM input support.

   - SplittingBAMIndexer can now be used from within the library as well as a
     command line tool and can index files directly in HDFS. Thanks to Thomas
     Robinson!

   - Various minor bug fixes.
   - Lots of documentation updates.
   - Various clarifications in the README.
   - Much quieter error messages when plugin loading fails.

   - build.xml now looks in the HADOOP_HOME environment variable for Hadoop
     .jars. As a result, the required minimum version of Ant is now 1.7.1.
   - fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.custom is now compiled with warnings off, for less
     noisy builds.

2012-01-18 --- 3.3:
   - Fix embedded Picard to not have an accidentally leftover dependency on
     Picard 1.47.

   - Clarify some .jar dependencies in the README.

2011-12-07 --- 3.2:
   - Important bug fix to avoid looping infinitely on some BAM files.

2011-12-05 --- 3.1:
   - Important data loss bug fixes!

   - 'sort' plugin updated to 2.0: it can now take multiple input files,
     merging them together.

   - New 'summary' and 'summarysort' command line plugins, respectively for
     creating and sorting Chipster summary files. Not very generically useful;
     intended more as example code.

   - Some minor command line argument handling bug fixes.

   - Updated embedded and provided Picard from 1.47 to 1.56.

   - As Hadoop-BAM now depends on Picard proper as well as the SAM-JDK, a
     compatible JAR, currently picard-1.56.jar, is distributed together with
     Hadoop-BAM.

2011-08-19 --- 3.0:
   - Plugin-extensible command line interface.
   - The 'view', 'sort', and 'index' command line plugins. These supersede the
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMReader and
     fi.tkk.ics.hadoop.bam.util.hadoop.BAMSort classes, which have much less
     functionality than the new plugins and are considered deprecated.
   - Embedded Picard SAM-JDK parts updated from version 1.27 to 1.47.
   - A compatible Picard SAM-JDK JAR, currently sam-1.47.jar, is now
     distributed together with Hadoop-BAM.

2011-06-01 --- 2.0:
   - Heuristic splitting of BAM and BGZF files: indexing is no longer required.
   - build.xml now defaults to making a .jar file, no need for explicit 'ant
     jar'.

2010-12-10 --- 1.0:
   - Initial release.
